You are a senior data scientist. Create a FORECASTING plan for Prophet only.

Return STRICT JSON ONLY with fields:
{
  "task": "forecast_prophet",
  "ds_col": "...",
  "y_col": "...",
  "regressors": ["...", "..."],
  "forecast_periods": 30,
  "freq": "D",
  "notes": "..."
}

Rules:
- ds_col must be a date/time column name from the dataset.
- y_col must be a numeric target column name.
- regressors must be empty or a subset of existing columns, excluding ds_col and y_col.
- forecast_periods should be a reasonable default (30) unless user_context provides an override.
- freq: choose D unless weekly/monthly is clearly implied by the data sample.
- If ambiguity exists, pick the BEST guess and explain in notes.
